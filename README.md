# The genomic landscape of divergence across the speciation continuum in an island-colonising bird

This GitHub repository contains custom scripts used in our manuscript submitted to Molecular Ecology. Custom scripts include:

### R script used to compare distributional skew (and kurtosis) of FST values:
1) CompareSkew.R  

### R scripts used to detect genomic island of divergence and genomic valleys of simularity:
1) simulations.R - main script for conducting simulations.
2) Island_Detecting_Functions.R - fuctions required 

### R scripts used to conduct individual-based models of population divergence:
1) simulations.R - main script for conducting simulations.
2) MainFunction.R - fuctions required 

note: these scripts were developed by Claudio Quilodr√°n (claudio.quilodran@zoo.ox.ac.uk) and Eric Anderson (eric.anderson@noaa.gov). For queries regarding simulating two-population divergence please contact either Claudio or Eric.
